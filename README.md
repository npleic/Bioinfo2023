# Bioinfo2023_Introduction-to-R
## Lecture materials and data for the "Introduction to R" workshop, MedILS School in Bioinformatics, August 2023.

### 1. Slides
The Introduction_to_R.pdf are the slides supporting the lecture.

### 2. Data
The diabetes_data.xlsx is a slightly modified version of the:
[Diabetes data](https://hbiostat.org/data/).

These data are courtesy of Dr John Schorling, Department of Medicine, University of Virginia School of Medicine.
The data consist of 19 variables on 403 subjects from 1046 subjects who were interviewed in a study to understand the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and other cardiovascular risk factors in central Virginia for African Americans. According to Dr John Hong, Diabetes Mellitus Type II (adult onset diabetes) is associated most strongly with obesity. The waist/hip ratio may be a predictor in diabetes and heart disease. DM II is also agssociated with hypertension - they may both be part of "Syndrome X". The 403 subjects were the ones who were actually screened for diabetes. Glycosolated hemoglobin > 7.0 is usually taken as a positive diagnosis of diabetes. For more information about this study see:
